Baseline Optimal Documentation
============================================

Baseline Optimal streamlines the exhaustive, iterative process in machine learning, replacing manual experimentation with automated workflows using Optuna's Bayesian optimization features.

With features like feature selection, missing value imputation, and scaling, the package evaluates pipeline performance across various ML algorithms. It offers a baseline-optimal approach, answering the question, "If I do nothing, how far can I get?" Results guide users to either celebrate success or refine strategies based on domain knowledge.
